## Accounted and not accounted ##
This is the vision of accounted and not accounted hours:

### Accounted ###
All accounted hours are directly deducted from the "must working hours" amount and means that these hours fit to the employer specifications contract (understand that these hours are profitable/beneficial to the boss or defined in the laws.)
Example: Tim have to work 40 hours by weeks. On monday, he enters 8 working hours on his main project. That's means he should yet work 32 hours more this week to have a 0 hours balance.
Example: Tim get married. Congratulations to him and his wife. Due to the law, tim's employer has to give him 2 days off. Accordingly, the week he takes these 2 days he should  work 24 hours left to have a 0 hours balance (40 - 2 x 8).

### Not accounted ###
Not accounted hours specifies hours which are not defined in contractual disposals.

But (there's always a but) non-working hours are not so simple. Expressing it with an exemple will be better: according to Tim's work's contract he have to visits his doctor outside his working hours. But his doctor offers him a rendez-vous at 15h00. Tim has 2 possibilities with timenote:
# just let his daytime with a blank between 14h00 and 17h00 (2 hours driving the path, 1 hours meeting).
# setting these 3 hours as not accounted hours, uncredited.
The advantage of the second method is to have this appointment archived. This means he could have saved this appointment in the past, or someone (an allowed person like his secretary) could have saved it for him. Additionally, his colleagues could know he would not be at his office and he could receive a reminder according to differents hours' behaviors.

## Hours behaviors ##
Behaviors can be defined to give a special meaning to the hours declared in a given project. For example, a maximum amount of working days can be set to "holidays" project. Or a maximum of 2 days per year can be credited to Tim for his marriage (hoping that this doesn't happen each year...)
By adding some behaviors to each project we will be able to know if the employee is here or not, is in vacation or not, travelling, and so ever.
