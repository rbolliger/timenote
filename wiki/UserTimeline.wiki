#summary This page details the user timeline, which represents the (planned) working hours of the user

The user declares his occupation in the "Hours" table. In order to know if the user has worked too much or not enough, timenote must know his planning.
The user_worktime table contains such data.

== Working principle == 

Planned hours are defined as a series until a change is performed. They are generated with a generator function, which accepts some parameters defining which days are considered, which ones have to be ignored (among considered days, ex: easter), starting and leaving hours.

The generator function is the following:

{{{

timeline = generate_timeline(start_at, workdays, offdays, hours_start, hours_stop)

}}}
