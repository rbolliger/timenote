== Introduction ==

Review of [http://letsfreckle.com/   Freckle] application (1 account 1 project free plan). (...)



== Review Info ==

OS: Windows Vista 64bit SP2

== Details ==

I start the registration for the free trial, the first step ask me what plan I want to sign for. Mainly the difference is in the maximum number of accounts allowed and SSL activation. I personally don't like to have to do this choice at this stage. In the end I'm forced to choose the free account with 1 user 1 project, because I don't feel like giving my CC information for a trial. Here end my 10 min registration (they claim 60 sec enough).
