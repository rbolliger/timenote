== Introduction ==

Review of [http://letsfreckle.com/   Freckle] application (1 account 1 project free plan). (...)



== Review Info ==

Reviewer: DBE

OS: Windows Vista 64bit SP2

Browser: Firefox 3.5.3, IE 8



== Details ==

I start the registration for the free trial, the first step ask me what plan I want to sign for. Mainly the difference is in the maximum number of accounts allowed and SSL activation. I personally don't like to have to do this choice at this stage. In the end I'm forced to choose the free account with 1 user 1 project, because I don't feel like giving my CC information for a trial. Here end my 10 min registration (they claim 60 sec enough).

After the first login you are advised to read a quick help and you can immediately begin using the application.

With this application you are able to create projects (only one for this review) with an hourly budget (and minimum time increment). then for a given day it is possible to enter the time spent on a project, with the possibility to tag this entry for better search.

You can access statistics of your daily effort on the projects (feed available) and report for the projects (exportable in csv).

There is the possibility to use an API and to integrate a timer in your firefox/safari/explorer browser (still in beta).

The graphic makes use of all possible colors, uses 2 top menus and one side menu. The page don't follow the browser size and waste a lot of space in wide screens. The possibility to hide unused parts of the interface can be useful and a good use of js.
