== Introduction ==

Review of [http://www.clockspot.net/   ClockSpot] application (demo). 



== Review Info ==

Reviewer: DBE

OS: Windows Vista 64bit SP2

Browser: Firefox 3.5.3, IE 8



== Details ==

To write this review I used the [http://demo.clockspot.net  demo] proposed by ClockSpot.

The graphics are simple and clear, with a double top menu and a side legend (autofit browser size).


=== User ===

The standard users basically have the possibility to start and stop a counter and for this counter choose a "job code" made from an administrator and add comments.

The user may modify the recorded times by sending a request to the administrator, he can also create tasks for other users.

The user can ask permission for an absence from a list of possible absence types (sickness, holiday,...).

The user has access to different information:
 * absences at disposal 
 * day schedules
 * Payrolls
 * Tasks
 * Timers
 

An internal message system can be used to contact all the users in the group.

Is not clear what the difference between a task, a timer and a jobcode.

It is possible to start or stop a timer by phone.



=== Administrator ===

The administrator has the role to create the Tasks, Timers (and timers cathegories), Jobcodes and absences. He has also to set the absences rights and confirm the times entered from the users and absences permissions.
Practically the administrator can edit everything a user has edited and can set global options that give users more or less right, but those option affect all users at one time.
