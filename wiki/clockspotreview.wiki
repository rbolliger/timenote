=== User ===

The standard users basically have the possibility to start and stop a counter and for this counter choose a "job code" made from an administrator and add comments.

The user may modify the recorded times by sending a request to the administrator, he can also create tasks for other users.

The user can ask permission for an absence from a list of possible absence types (sickness, holiday,...).

The user has access to different information:
 * absences at disposal 
 * day schedules
 * Payrolls
 * Tasks
 * TImers
 

An internal message system can be used to contact all the users in the group
