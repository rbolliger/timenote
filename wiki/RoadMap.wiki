= Versioning =
*major*.*minor*.*micro*

The major, minor and micro fields are integer numbers represented in decimal notation and have the following meaning:
  * *major* - When the major version changes (in ex. from "1.5.12" to "2.0.0"), then backward compatibility with previous releases is not granted.
  * *minor* - When the minor version changes (in ex. from "1.5.12" to "1.6.0"), then backward compatibility with previous releases is granted, but something changed in the implementation of the Component. (ie it methods could have been added)
  * *micro* - When the micro version changes (in ex. from "1.5.12" to "1.5.13"), then the the changes are small forward compatible bug fixes or documentation modifications etc.
