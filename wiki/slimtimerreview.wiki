= Details =

The registration is fast and easy (no mail confirmation, no image to text, few fields to fill). Timezone and date format are asked at registration.

Just after registration you can start to use [http://www.slimtimer.com   SlimTimer] by opening the "timer" in a new window and easily create tasks (they can be tagged or shared with other users) and start/stop the recording of their duration. There is the possibility to put the Timer in the system tray (Windows only) (not tested). With the timer is not possible to record 2 tasks at the same time (but is possible by opening 2 timers!)

When a task duration has been measured an entry in created. An entry can be tagged and commented. The entry can be edited for corrections afterward.

All sorts of Reports can be generated for different periods of time, that contain the time spent on each tasks (or even tags) for every user.

An API is at disposal for entries and tasks manipulations. formats available are XML, YAML and JSON. The API use POST http method.
