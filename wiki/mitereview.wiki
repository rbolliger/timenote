== Introduction ==

Review of [http://mite.yo.lk/en/   Mite] application (30 days free trial). (...)



== Review Info ==

Reviewer: DBE

OS: Windows Vista 64bit SP2

Browser: Firefox 3.5.3, IE 8



== Details ==

The free trial registration is a painless 6 fields form with a confirmation code sent to your e-mail.

There are 3 kind of users:
- the administrator
- the users
- the limited users

The pricing for this utility is 5€ per user per month

The graphics are simple and clear, but personally I don't feel the design too appealing. I also find the difference between the *whites* colors of the main area and the background to small.

A particular feature is the undo button that gives you the possibility to cancel your last action.

The webpages are available in English and German and US Dollar and many European currency are at disposal.

Integration with Twitter and Jabber is possible.
