# DBE review #

## Introduction ##

Review of [Mite](http://mite.yo.lk/en/) application (30 days free trial). Complete application, easy to use, just lacking absences handling.



## Review Info ##

Reviewer: DBE

OS: Windows Vista 64bit SP2

Browser: Firefox 3.5.3, IE 8



## Details ##

The free trial registration is a painless 6 fields form with a confirmation code sent to your e-mail.

There are 3 kind of users:
- the administrator
- the users
- the limited users

The pricing for this utility is 5€ per user per month

The graphics are simple and clear, but personally I don't feel the design too appealing. I also find the difference between the **whites** colors of the main area and the background to small.

A particular feature is the undo button that gives you the possibility to cancel your last action.

The webpages are available in English and German and US Dollar and many European currency are at disposal.

Integration with Twitter and Jabber is possible. AN API is also at disposal.



### Administrator ###


The first step is the creation of customers, projects, services and users.

Customers are projects givers. Projects may be linked to an users and have an hour or a money budget associated. Services are general activities that may be linked to an hourly remuneration. Users may be "user" or "limited user" associated with an email address.

The "administrator" can than select a project and/or a service and clock the time spent on it with a timer or by manually entering the time spent on the task.

Is possible to backup all the data in XML or YAML/JSON format anytime.

All sort of report can be displayed for users, projects and services.


### User ###

The "user" as all the rights of the "administrator" account except the ones linked at the user  management. They also can't access payments details of the "administrator".



### Limited user ###

Limited Users can only access a defined set of projects to clock their work time. they also can only have reports of their working times
